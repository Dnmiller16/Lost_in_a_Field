You wake up in a grassy field with no memory of what happened last night. You search your pockets and find that you only have a stick of gum, a rusty razor blade, and a bag of white powder. There is also a dog running around the farm that looks vaguely familiar. As you come to you glance at your watch you notice that it is Thursday at 800 a.m, ONE AND A HALF HOURS BEFORE YOUR BIG JOB INTERVIEW! You begin to panic but then realize that you are just a 25-minute drive outside of town, and can still make it. Now if you just had a car. . .

What happened last night?
An Interactive Fiction by Dakota Miller

Field
A large grassy field with a large apple tree in the center of it and a large patch of tall grass next to you. You can just see the sun rising over the shed which is to the east.  To the north is the barn and to the south is a corn field.
