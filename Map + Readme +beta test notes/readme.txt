What is the setting of your game?
The setting of my game is that you wake up in the middle of a grassy field and do not remember what happened last night. You have a job interview in one and a half hours and must find a car so you can drive back into town and not miss you job interview.

What are some of the puzzles that you created/experimented with?
One puzzle i experimented with was a key that was on the dogs collar that moved from room to room on each turn. I also tried to have the player fix the car with a car part but couldn’t fit it into the story well enough, so i dropped it.

What are the two rooms? What are the three objects?
I have five rooms: field, barn, shed, cornfield, and carport as well as 45 different items/objects. 

Please discuss, in detail, one thing you learned how to do, and how you figured it out.
One thing i learned how to do in this project was how to make a door. At first my door was functional up until you tried to walk through it. I fixed this with help from Mrs. Kiang by removing that it was closed in it’s coding. This is because by default doors are closed and unlocked when something is specified to be a door. Saying that the door was closed in the code for some reason made it unable to be walked through.

What resources were most helpful to you in your learning Inform?
Mrs. kiang and her wiki as well as goongle and the inform handbook.
